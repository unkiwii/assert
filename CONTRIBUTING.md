# Contributing to unkiwii/assert

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. Below are some
suggestions which may make the process easier.

## Bug fixes

Pull requests for bug fixes are always appreciated, they should be preceded by
an issue explaining the bug. The pull request should always include a test
which fails without the bug fix.

## Other pull requests

Growing the API will not be accepted, the idea behind this package is to keep
the API as simple as possible and the current API is the simplest we could get.

Any other change that doesn't grow the API should be preceded by an issue
explaining why the change is necessary
